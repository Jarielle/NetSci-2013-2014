"Quantifying Similarity of Benign and Oncongenic Viral Proteins Using Amino Acid Sequence"


Infectious disease result in millions of deaths annually, mechanism of how to destroy or keep a pathogenesis virus from spreading are continuously being analyzed. Determining which human protein targets are most susceptible to being attacked by a viral protein can aid in the prevention of these attacks. The prevalence of viral oncogenicity is increasing; preventing the spread of these viruses is critical to society.  Using programming tools data has been analyzed on the oncogenicity of viruses and the similarity of amino acids sequences of these viruses. With Gephi a visualization has been created.
